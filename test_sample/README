The data files in this directory were created on a Dec AXP 3000/600
using 'make test' in cosmics.  The *.asc files are ascii versions of the
binaries produced by grafic.  By compiling and running the program
compar, you can gain confidence that the cosmics codes work properly
on your machine.  You must first have done 'make test' yourself
and have its results intact in test_results.  Note that the test does
not compare the large binary files output by linger and grafic,
lingerg.dat, delta.dat, and p3m.dat.  However, if the other tests
succeed and the test.out is similar to the one you produce, then you
may safely assume the tests have succeeded.
