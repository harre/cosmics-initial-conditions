COSMICS is a package of programs for computing cosmological initial
conditions for nonlinear structure formation codes as well as microwave
background anisotropy.  For detailed information please read cosmics.tex
(cosmics.ps).

How to build the codes:
----------------------

1.  Read grafic/README and edit grafic/grafic.inc for your needs.
        grafic.inc only needs to be changed if you want to output
	initial positions and velocities of particles for a nonlinear
	simulation.

2.  Type 'make' in the top-level directory cosmics; you will be provided
        a list of target architectures.  Select the appropriate one (e.g.,
        sgi) and type 'make sgi'.  COSMICS has been successfully built
	and tested on the platforms listed in Ported.

        Executables are copied to the subdirectory bin.

3.  If the make fails, or your machine doesn't appear in the list, try
	making with one of the other targets.  If that still fails,
	send me the standard output produced by your make, and I'll
	try to solve the problem.

4.  'make test' tests all of the programs.  The results appear in
	subdirectory test_results.  Examine the file test.out,
	especially the last section of summary results.  Note: the
	tests take about 27 MFlops-hours to complete.  The CMB
	calculations are slow; use a fast workstation or a
	supercomputer.  For detailed checks, cd test_sample,
	compile compar.f, uncompress p3m0[a-b].asc.Z, and run compar.
	compar compares the files in test_results with a sample run
	performed previously.  The largest errors should be less than 1.e-4.

5.  'make clean' removes object files; 'make realclean' also removes
	bin and test_results.

COSMICS will be evolving with time, as new features are added and any
existing problems are solved.  To get on a mailing list for updates,
or to notify me of bugs or problems, send email to edbert@mit.edu.
