06/22/03: Corrected dtbdla in subroutine inithermo (linger_con, linger_syn)
	  Thanks to Christian Mueller for pointing out numerical errors.
	  Wrapped call nu2 in linger_con and linger_syn to prevent compiler
	  from complaining.
	  Updated default parameter suggestions in subroutine setup
	  (linger_con, linger_syn).

07/11/02: Updated my email to edbert@mit.edu.
	  Changed makefiles to work under Linux.
	  Fixed a bug in grafic/power.f, where tcon should have been
	  declared double precision.  Thanks to David Kahana for providing
	  the Makefile fixes and finding the bug.

05/14/01: Grafic/power.f: changed lines 95 and 159 to compute the
          correct transfer function with vacuum energy, by replacing
          -4.*(omegam-1.0) by -4.*(omegam+omegab-1.0)
	  Thanks to Ken Nagamine for pointing this out.

06/16/95: Linger: Change dtau1*ak from 20 to 10 to improve convergence
	  for high ak.  Also, allow n1=1 in case ifulbol=0 (setup).
	  Slightly changed output format of p3m.dat in grafic.
