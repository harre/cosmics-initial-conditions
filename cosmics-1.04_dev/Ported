COSMICS has been successfully built and tested on:

Pentium IV PC running Red Hat Linux 7.2
Convex C3880 running ConvexOS 11.0
Cray C90 running Unicos 8.0
Dec AXP 3000/600 running OSF/1 v2.1
IBM SP-2 (RS6000/540) running AIX 3
IBM RS6000/370 running AIX 3.2
SGI Indigo-2 running IRIX 5.3
Sun 4/690 running SunOS 4.1.3_U1

COSMICS fails to build on Decstations running (at least) Ultrix 4.3, due
to Ultrix problems with shell commands in makefiles.  It can still be
built manually by going into linger_con, linger_syn, and deltat, renaming
the *.f.generic files to *.f, and compiling them separately with f77 -O2
(in the linger directories, be sure to compile and link dverk.f also).
Grafic can be built manually with f77 -O *.f in directory grafic.
This manual procedure should also work for other systems that have problems
with makefiles.

Please let me know of other systems on which COSMICS builds
successfully.
