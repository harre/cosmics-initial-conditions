This directory contains the version 1.0 release of my Gaussian random
field initial conditions program.  It can generate unconstrained or
constrained realizations given the power spectrum and constraints.
As part of its initialization, it also can compute the CMB quadrupole
moment corresponding to a given sigma_8 or vice versa, and can save
to disk the matter power spectrum.

You must do the following to run grafic!
----------------------------------------

1.  Edit grafic.inc to set the number of particles, the geometry of
    the initial particle lattice, the number of constraints (or 1
    if no constraints; you'll be prompted at runtime as to whether
    you want any constraints at all), and the number of output records.

2.  If you wish to constrain the Gaussian random field, set ncon in
    grafic.inc and edit subroutine constr.f.

3.  run make in the main cosmics directory and follow the instructions.
    Alternatively, run make in the grafic directory (to link the default
    fft), or "make ARCH=CRAY" to link the Cray FFT (Cray only), or
    "make ARCH=CONVEX" to link the Convex FFT (Convex with veclib only).
    It should be straightforward to modify the FFT routines to use fast
    library routines on other machines (e.g., ESSL on IBM).

4.  run grafic and respond to its prompts.


Notes:
------

1.  A non-cubic particle lattice may be used with np1 != np2 != np3.  However,
    all must be divisible by 2.  It is not necessary to use a power of 2
    (the fft included here can accomodate any prime factorization) although
    it is most efficient to maximize the number of factors of 2 (and, possibly,
    3,4,5 if you use Cray or Convex libraries).  Note that the unit cell
    of the mesh is required to be cubic (with size dx*dx*dx); only the
    totals lengths (np1*dx, np2*dx, np3*dx) may be non-cubic.

2.  grafic writes two data files, delta.dat and p3m.dat, as its final output
    (initial conditions for cosmological simulation codes), written as follows:
        open(10,file='delta.dat',status='unknown',form='unformatted')
	rewind 10
	write(10) np1,np2,np3,dx,astart,omegam,omegav,h0
	write(10) (((delta(i,j,k),i=1,np1),j=np2,k=np3)
	close(10)

    and
	open(10,file='p3m.dat',status='unknown',form='unformatted')
	rewind 10
	write(10) npart,np1,np2,np3,dx,epsilon,astart,omegam,omegav,h0,
     2                  dt,etat,nstep,ekin,egrav,egint
	write(10) ((x(idim,j),idim=1,3),j=1,npart)
	write(10) ((v(idim,j),idim=1,3),j=1,npart)
	close(10)
    npart=np1*np2*np3 is the number of particles; dx is the mean
    interparticle spacing in comoving Mpc (not Mpc/h); epsilon is the
    desired Plummer softening distance for p3m (in comoving Mpc, not
    used in pm); a is the expansion factor; omegam and omegav are Omega
    in matter and vacuum energy at a=1; H0 is the Hubble constant at a=1
    (in km/s/Mpc); dt is the suggested first timestep; etat is a parameter
    used in setting the timestep (set to <= .05 for decent integration
    accuracy); nstep is the number of timesteps; ekin,egrav,egint are
    the kinetic, gravitational, and integrated gravitational energies
    (used in the Layzer-Irvine check; they are proper energies per
    particle in units of (km/s)**2).  The positions have units of
    comoving Mpc while the velocities are peculiar velocities in units
    of proper km/s.
